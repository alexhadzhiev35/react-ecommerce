# React client + Node server

To install the project:

-Navigate to server directory and run the server with (node server.js). Make sure you have nodeJS installed!

-Install the dependencies of the client with (npm install) and run the server with (npm run dev)

- I do not have right over the server as it is practice server made by the team of Softuni.
